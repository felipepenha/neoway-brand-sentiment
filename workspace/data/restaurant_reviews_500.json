Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, \" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?\" She does. \n\nMy hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard \"mmmm this is so good\" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone.\n\nSo-\n\nDo order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels. \n\nIf they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny. \n\nDo make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don't go with a date unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it's available.","useful":0,"user_id":"w31MKYsNFMrjhWxxAb5wIw"}

Fancy!\n\nA simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side. \n\nI also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it! \n\nI'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled.

A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a \"rice bowl\" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.\n\nI'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a \"C\" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room. \n\nMmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken\/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. \n\nThe jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. \n\nThey provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. \n\nNot gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day.","useful":1,"user_id":"JSrP-dUmLlwZiI7Dp3PQ2A"}

However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood\/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.\n\nOk onto the food.

My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries.

I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.\n\nThe portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) \n\nI bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then?

However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.\n\nFirst, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.\n\nI expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25!

Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long.

We, my boyfriend and I,  saw their ad on their website for an $$85 per couple Valentine's Day Dinner.  We had reservations for 6p.m. this reservation was made on Friday, we dined on Saturday. When we arrived right at 6p.m. there were plenty of OPEN tables in the restaurant.  When the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14.  The list said in large print at the top..DO NOT CHANGE TABLES.  The hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!  Could we have asked to sit elsewhere? Apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables.  Could we have dined elsewhere...probably not considering it is Valentines Weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else, and no idea at 6p.m. where to go.  \n\nSo we sat.  We could hear EVERY WORD the table next to us said. (Which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for Valentine's Day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how \"hot\" her female coworker is.)  This was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info. Most uncomfortable \"romantic\" evening of my life...\n\nNow to the food.  The Valentine's Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a \"salad\", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.\n\n\nThe soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.\n\nThe appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!\n\nThe salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!  Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.\n\nThe meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.\n\nThe dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet...   Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3\/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?\n\nThe wine - Nero D'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...\n\nThe atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  By the time I left, my toes were frozen.\n\nWe finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple! \n\nUpon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.\n\nWould I go back when in town again? No.  At the risk of being sat in that situation again.  The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.\n\nAnd to the lady we sat next to...Good luck on your birth, maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth.","useful":0,"user_id":"7-Wb8rDEymidPPfShLX3Yg"}

The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced.\nThe worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back.

However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much, I'd like to feel a little more pampered.","useful":0,"user_id":"XQDfhRd54J7OgimNNxdAcg"}

Their service however, is probably the WORST I've ever had. I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat. \n\nWhen we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was \"going to be complicated or not.\" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too. \n\nI had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service.

Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.\n\nOur party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.\n\nThe menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.\n\nFor dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.\n\nEvery wine pairing we tried was amazing.\n\nUnfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations. \n\nExpect to be here for a while.

(You are old like me if you know that theme song!)\n\nHave you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.\n\nSome call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.\n\nReservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!\n\nBeing in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  \n\nSo if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  \n\nThe food:\n\nComplimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.\n\nCaesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.\n\nBread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  \n\nSpaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  \n\nLinguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.\n\nTiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.\n\nLemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.\n\nLadies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!\n\nTL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.\n\n2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.\n\nThe search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!","useful":2,"user_id":"zCnJQKvZgET4llBbJD1aiw"}

The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.\n\nThe enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were saut\u00e9ed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.\n\nWarning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy.

The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup. \n\nI really recommend going to Rubios for a lighter refreshing meal, try the fish tacos and sign up for their club for emails on special offers.","useful":0,"user_id":"gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw"}

I ordered what I've always ordered. A bean burrito, a taco and a drink. It cost over $9 dollars!! The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy\/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!!

The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. \n\nLast time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.\n\nI paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. \n\nWhen we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin. \n\nI walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"I'll be right with you.\" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say \"Wow, you are really something else.\" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. \n\nI honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction\/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.\n\nI realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.","useful":6,"user_id":"TTZyVCWsQXXkRIwiwSYKKQ"}

Let me explain...\n\nThere are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value\/frequent\/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. \n\nFOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? \n\nI'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  \n\nI ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. \n\nA few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. \n\nSERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. \n\nI won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.\n\nService: 4 stars\n\nKitch: 4 stars\n\nFood: 1 star","useful":13,"user_id":"2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ"}

I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.\n\nWe walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  \n\nMy family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  \n\nIn the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.","useful":2,"user_id":"R38mW_Uyp46JHToxobXQXg"}

I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. \n\nOne really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. \n\nDefinitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas.

They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right. \n\nMoving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere.

The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too!

If you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq.  An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.\n\nIn most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because I don't love the almighty Kabob, it's because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.\n\nThe interiors and d\u00e9cor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I've come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  I'm glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.\n\nHats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you'll meet.","useful":5,"user_id":"xCANz0ccZ9-WPJUk8oZr3g"}

And, did I mention, you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  Yep!  Best snickerdoodles around, and one comes with every dish!\n\nIf you haven't been to Chino's - it's time - make a run for the border\/great wall\/beach!\n(and make sure to read the non-PC T-shirts while you wait - funny!)","useful":2,"user_id":"Olo_x4fV1sFBtlj6COf9Wg"}

Did not disappoint! A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as \"butter\" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates!\nThe end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came.

As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple?

I've never been much of a ribs person, but the entire family goes ga-ga over the ribs. It's like a \"don't you dare touch my leftovers\" kinda feeling after eating here. The waitress\/hostess we had was pretty awesome too. Her positive attitude and the info she provided about menu items made it a comfortable environment for us.

This is after only my second experience here. My first experience was in the summer where I hung around the bar (on the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat on) and things were pretty cheery.\n\nThis time I ordered from the happy hour menu & apparently when you do this, you must sit at the bar---lame. The bartendress was in a super bitchy mood and poked fun at the fact that I was ordering from the happy hour menu. HELLO? We're not all snobby rich middle-aged Myers Park folk. I prefer beer & I wanted some Olde Mecklenburg Brewery Mecktoberfest, but the bartendress convinces me it isn't good because it's the last of the keg. Great. Personally, I don't do cheap beer, and nothing else looked good, so I stuck with water. At this, she snickers, \"so just water and some apps.....MMMKAYY\" while giving stink eyes. Excuse me? Who pissed in your cornflakes, lady? \n\nEventually the order comes in: Risotto fritters, Gouda grilled cheese and tomato fondue, koby beef sliders, weird salmon dip. All that was pretty good, no complaints there. This was the whole reason I came in the first place.\n\nNEEDLESS TO SAY I LEFT A GOOD TIP BECAUSE I'M THAT KIND OF A GUY. But honestly, this woman did not deserve one stinking penny, and I'll probably never go back here because of her attitude. It's sad to say because I live in this neighborhood and I like supporting this neighborhood's businesses. \n\nI work with all sorts of people on a daily basis, and work for tips myself, and it benefits no one when you bring your foul mood to the table, in fact it only detracts from possible future business.","useful":2,"user_id":"3OJ3tT5NGLGGWLivvt6btQ"}

It's a great before\/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.\n\nI ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.\n\nI also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. \n\nThey brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.\n\nYes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards).

It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)\n\nThere was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow \"oversized\" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.\n\nOK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!

I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store.  The store inside the mall is very cute.  The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.

We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird.

Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.\n\nI've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.\n\nI've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.  \n\nOf the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.   \n\nThe only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.\n\nI have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?\n\nBut alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist.","useful":7,"user_id":"v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g"}

We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12\" x 12\" square and 10-12\" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8\" square base, next layer 6\" base and the top layer 4\" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4\" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1\/2\" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on.","useful":2,"user_id":"FW29hLeFEeVO9XpMFEgI4Q"}

They have a wide variety of items including ice cream, coffee, desserts, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, tea, etc. Very reasonably priced menu! I got the tuna melt, it was just ok.

I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now.\nAtmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic\/intimate one. \nService: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.\nFood (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.\nFood (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this \"ironic\"; I say, \"tacky!\" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting \"Go back to Denny's\", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal.\nSo, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price.","useful":2,"user_id":"5gGMfEiTpZaAGlpRcvCM4w"}

I went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend. The selection was pretty good, and every time I returned, there was more stuff.

The rolls were rolled well, too.\n\nAs for freshness, only what I think was the hamachi was maybe off. I am sure it depends on when you go. I tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because I thought they were good enough to warrant it.\n\nThe service was friendly.

Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.\n  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste.

(See what I did there?)\n\nI already wasn't really thrilled about coming to this joint. I checked the reviews, they weren't really poppin. I looked at pics, weren't enough of them. And the menu looked... okay.\n\nBut I'm always down for something new and different and my homie was eager to check this place out, so why not?\n\nWelp, it wasn't good my friend. \n\nI ordered the Packhouse burger; because, if you can't do a burger right, then something is seriously wrong. And it was ALL wrong. Not once but twice.\n\nMy other homie decides to get the same thing. She didn't want the tomato jam (she's allergic to tomatoes) and she wanted hers cooked medium well. I wanted the tomato jam and my meat to be cooked medium. You following so far? \n\nWe both asked for the Mac and cheese as a side. Side note: why do they not have fries???!!! Not even sweet potato fries???!! Like forreal tho. Anyway, they bring out my homies burger and my other friends dish. They bring out my food last. There's a TON of mustard on my burger. Literally all I can taste is mustard. They killed my meat. Like if the cow wasn't dead before they cooked it, they made sure they killed it when they grilled it. And after a few bites I noticed I didn't have any tomato jam. Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger. \n\nThey were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!!\n\nNew Burgers come out, they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard. \n\nThe Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda, but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well.\n\nMy other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well. \n\nAlso we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point. \n\nThe desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good. \n\nThe oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this, would love it! \n\nSo there you have it. \n\nThe service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff, but I'm sorry guys, the food needs some work. \n\nThe location and setup is dope. The vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice. If they work on the food, I can see this place getting packed with the quickness.","useful":4,"user_id":"yy7shAsNWRbGg-8Y67Dzag"}

I was disappointed I could only order scrambled eggs on the side when I wanted a gooey poached egg because they had already cracked all the eggs, so I skipped the eggs.\n\nAs we finished up our main course our sweet crepe came out.  I was surprised how full I was from the one savory crepe, but I made room for my half of a simple bruleed crepe with nuts.  You can really taste the quality of the crepe itself when it's minimally dressed.  We finished with the complementary dessert of chocolate triangles and a rose infused marshmallow roasted right at the table.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with our experience and the friendly service.  We struck up some good conversation with the server and found everyone but the cashier to be friendly.  I will definitely be back soon!","useful":0,"user_id":"F8qiePXPy9rsum5sYEbZkw"}

Which sucks cuz this place's best deal, is their \"before 11am, $2.49 breakfast.\"\n\nI've had everything from their Eggs Benedict to their salad bar. Their salad bar is very basic. Cheap square croutons, fake Baco Bits, half-wilted(so take your time picking out the good lettuce, and leave the crap to another patron, haha) lettuce, and OK dressings. I get it. They can't have fresh stuff at this price.\n\nBack to the Eggs Benedict. Everything on the Benny was cheap. The English muffin WASN'T TOASTED! Never seen that before. The hash browns were WAY too crispy.. Like eating unflavored Pop Rocks.. The Hollandaise sauce was just ok..\n\nAll in all, if you're very hungry and either cheap or on a budget, stop on in..

I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event. \n\nWe had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) \n- Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) \n- A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)\n- Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  \n- Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. \n- Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! \n- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) \n- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! \n- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.  \n\n***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol \n\nOVERALL RATINGS:\nFood - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)\nFood (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! \nDrink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio\nPresentation - 4 stars\nService & Ambiance - 4 stars\n\nI gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!","useful":2,"user_id":"siQe3vg4d81AtOGMvyAIJw"}

However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real! \n\nSo with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy. \n\nOkay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it. \n\nStarted with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.\n\nBeef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.\n\nThe Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious. \n\nThe Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra. \n\nDesserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!\n\nThis was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!","useful":8,"user_id":"p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag"}

Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato.

DC Steak House is a rarity in Phoenix; a mid-priced, independent steak houses in a sea of chain restaurants and a la carte wallet busters.\n\nLooks:  Well, it does look fairly similar to the previous restaurants, except they changed the bar area and the art.  I like it.  It's elegant and not too dark or too partitioned.  There's a mural on one wall that I think the owner painted.  The place is a nice addition to Downtown, which is still fighting off the urban sprawl of mega-chains.\n\nCrowd:  Seemed happening, although it was Opening Night.  A wide mix of young and old.\n\nFood:  My eye was drawn to the large selection of fish, but I decided to go with steak at a steak house.  The salad was solid.  I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it.  Bread was OK.  My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms.  My friend ordered the walleye.  I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota.  Maybe that was a fish story.\n\nValue:  Here's where I thought this place shined.  Meals were in the $18-30 range, including salad and potato.  They have $10 sandwiches, too, but they're not served on Fri\/Sat until after 9pm.  Seems fair.\n\nService:  Service was slow, although it was Opening Night.  They also screwed up my friend's appetizer, serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce.  However, the people could not have been nicer.  The owner apologized and bought us desserts.  (Chocolate Decadence Cake was delicious, although a little rich for my taste.)  Then, the chef came out , shook our hands, and bought us drinks.  I felt like I was in a place where people would remember my name, even though they surely won't.\n\nMiscellaneous:  A lot of decisions haven't been made yet.  Will they serve lunch?

Even the menu will likely vary in the coming months.\n\nVerdict:  I don't go out for steaks often, even reasonably priced ones, but I'll definitely be back to DC Steakhouse to see my new \"friends.\"  I've got my eye on the steak sandwich for next time.","useful":4,"user_id":"zxsGLpHvzbVqNDm4svFQ5g"}

The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?\n\nThere are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the \"membership line\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  \n\nThe second line, is to \"check in\" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  \n\nBoth of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  \n\nAfter all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  \n\nThen, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  \n\nWe head to our bay with a \"bay concierge\" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  \n\nWe start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a \"slider\" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.\n\nWhen the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\"  The server leaned in all interested.... \"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \"could we have napkins?\" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.\n\nSo, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.\n\nThe kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  \n\nOK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   \n\nAgain, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.","useful":2,"user_id":"NtIT_KStxOH09714OkbKOw"}

Pad Thai was flavourless and honestly Thai express does it better :\/ the snacks to share are super pricy for what they are, it was 10$ for 3 tiny satay skewers, and another 10$ for 4 tiny pieces of popcorn chicken on a small bed of rice. \nIf youre coming here just for drinks I wouldnt say don't go but if youre looking for drinks and asian food I would 100% brasserie Pamika, it is much better in terms of flavour and authenticity and also has a cool trendy vibe","useful":1,"user_id":"S5oMD5z3sQ2K93UunjBBUQ"}

Yes, there are clubs better than TAO, and better restaurants than the Grand Lux, but those hotels with don't have great service or great decor or rooms as the Venetian.

The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the \"Halal\" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.  The decor needs work to give this place a more intimate atmosphere as it was a pizza joint for many years but don't let that stop you from going in.

We ordered: the Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice ($6.50), the Malaysian Street Style Sandwich ($5.99), soy milk tea ($1.80) and the hot honey lemon juice ($1.80). The Malaysian Curry was delicious but really, really oily (you could literally see the pools of oil gathering on top of the bowl). If you're fine with that (which I was), you'll probably still enjoy it. The sandwich was our highlight - it really filling but still super light and tasty (the bread was white toast, crispy and buttered). It was stuffed with everything it promised, but it didn't make you feel gross afterwards. With the tea, it was a great, comforting Saturday morning meal!\n\nLocated right beside the Erindale GO Station in the same plaza as Sushi Tei, Chili Chicken House, and Wonton Chai Noodle (among others), on the northwest corner of Creditview and Burnhamthorpe, and a few minutes away from the Mavis exit of Highway 403, this place really gives you bang for your buck. Plus, the food is delicious, prepared fresh. Overall, a really enjoyable meal. \n\nOur total with tax was around $18.00. With tip, we paid around $21.00.

Yes, we're fatsos at heart. \n\nThe drinks came in a timely manner, as did the donuts. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. AND WAITED. We are by no means slow eaters and we didn't stick around for very long after finishing our food, but we didn't leave this restaurant until close to 3pm! It was quite absurd how long our main dishes took to arrive. Definitely unimpressed with the service. \n\nAs for the food itself, I'd call it 'decent'.

My duck scramble was good but nothing special. I loved the potatoes, but everything else just...normal. \n\nHonestly, the best part about this place, in my opinion, is that it takes brunch reservations.
