The steak sauce with which it was served is very one-dimensional, and did not pair well with the arugula/parmesan garnish at all. Would avoid the sauce if you want to taste the beef. My wife's filet (ordered rare) was medium-rare at the thicker end of the cut --yes, a filet with a thicker end-- and was medium/medium-well at the thinner end. This imparted a chalky mouthfeel to what should have been a silky cut of beef.\n",

The fries were a sad portion, with a few full-length fries that were cooked right, and the rest of the portion looked like the leftovers from the bottom of the fry-basket --short and burnt. The truffle oil was applied too liberally and smelled almost scorched. My wife's steak was served with yukon gold mashed in a cast iron skillet, and they were moist and delicious.
