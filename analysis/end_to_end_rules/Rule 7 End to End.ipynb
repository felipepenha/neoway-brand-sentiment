Somewhere recently, maybe Lucky Peach, I was reading about the rise in sort of \"vegetarian charcuterie\". I scoffed, because to me charcuterie means meat, and it's sacrilegious to say otherwise, but some of those photos looked pretty fun, I *do* like pickled daikon, and I've found lately with charcuterie boards that I can have some vicious heartburn afterwards, so I figured I'd best keep an open mind.\n",
