this is the kind of employee you need more of!\\n\\nnow the bad: 7700 s autoplex\\n\\ni first went to this location because i needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. i got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. i also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. i let that all slide, as just being an off day.\\n\\ni then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. i also let that slide.\\n\\ni then went to get a wash yesterday. not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before i came! to begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. there was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. the only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. there were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.\\n\\nwhen i pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. i was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. the manager, who i do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. i remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because i knew they caused the problem. at this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. they were disrespectful and discourteous.\\n\\nfinally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. they asked me to come back the next day. obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.\\n\\ni went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.\\n\\nthe next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, i discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. \\n\\ni knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. also these were obviously clean panties, so i gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.\\n\\ni suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact i was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality tv.\\n\\nas a result i was livid. i had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.\\n\\ni went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. they clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. \\n\\nthey reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. at this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when i brought the car in. i was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.\\n\\njared to the rescue:\\n\\ni took the car directly to the 616 location and saw jared busily working with his staff. i pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. after being checked in i called out to jared and explained the situation to him. he dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  this was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.\\n\\nlesson: never go to the 7700 location! always go to the 616 location!\\n\\ncobblestone, bad managers make for a bad staff. great managers make for a great staff.\",\n",

              " (\"i've heard great things about toast for breakfast and lunch so thought we might get it a try for dinner...  we walked in around 6:30pm on a friday night,  the restaurant was about half filled. there were plenty of seats in the the front of the restaurant but our party of four was seated in the very back beside the bathrooms and back door.  we sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat)  but  we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits.  we politely ask if we could move to the front.  the hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it.  the same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) .  \\nwe were brought a loaf of soft bread to table, pretty tasty but the butter is a little different.  it is a sweet butter with orange zest.  \\nwe were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish i happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli.  i ordered the mushroom ravioli,  my husband the lasagna, our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat), and chicken marsala with ravioli side.   the server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us...... so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side. when our  meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered.  he was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom). \\ni was told by my friends that the chicken marsala and chicken pot pie were good. my husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! i could only eat a couple bits, he couldn't finish it.  my mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless. the cream sauce was very watery. i did not enjoy my main dish at all.  \\non the bright side though, we all got salads and really enjoyed them. i had the small blue wedge salad. it was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top. really good! \\n our server disappeared  while we were eating our meal.  the lady who had been refilling our waters took over our table and closed our checks.  as we were leaving, we see our server  sitting behind the bar, playing on his phone and chatting with other guests....\\nwe probably will not be returning to toast for dinner. it just seemed way to pretentious and we were not impressed by the food or the 93.5 sanitation grade.\",\n",

(you are old like me if you know that theme song!)\\n\\nhave you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  that was our experience.\\n\\nsome call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  if you want a seat on the patio on friday or saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.\\n\\nreservations are taken by phone and i will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... i was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!\\n\\nbeing in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  \\n\\nso if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  \\n\\nthe food:\\n\\ncomplimentary bruschetta:  a plain pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. go to la bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.\\n\\ncaesar salad:  crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.\\n\\nbread basket:  now i know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard i was worried i would break a tooth, and i also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when i was expecting crusty italian bread.  \\n\\nspaghetti carbonara:   the reason we came was because hubby was craving carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  \\n\\nlinguini di mamma ninetta:  i love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... with just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.\\n\\ntiramisu:  no coffee flavour!  i have made tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and i know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that i was expecting.   libretto's tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that fieramosca's lacked.  my favourite dessert when done well, i left disappointed.\\n\\nlemon sorbet:  frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from italy.  i actually liked it better than the sad face tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  i joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.\\n\\nladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  ugh!\\n\\ntl;dr - meh. bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  not worth a second visit.\\n\\n2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.\\n\\nthe search for pasta carbonara continues... maybe a trip to nyc or even rome!\",\n",

              " (\"this place is definitely a local spot. we stumbled in on friday around 7pm to a karaoke night! everyone seemed to know one another and felt like family (some may have actually been family. it was so intimate they even celebrated the monthly birthdays and sang to a woman with a birthday crown on. definitely felt like a regular karaoke group that returns each week. everyone welcomed us, even new people that came in said hello and told us about the karaoke nights and to come back again soon. despite the closeness of the patrons we didn't feel like an outsider. \\n\\nfood: you go and order at the counter and then sit and they will bring it to you. the woman at the counter was very friendly and helped us making our decisions. they have a wide variety of items including ice cream, coffee, desserts, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, tea, etc. very reasonably priced menu! i got the tuna melt, it was just ok. the tuna salad was a bit too over dressed for my liking. it felt gluttonous with all the mayonnaise and i think there was mustard in there maybe? it came with a side and i chose coleslaw, it felt kind of like the kind you would buy in a big jar at sam's club, not my favorite but others like their sides so maybe i'll try something else next time. the others liked the chips and the macaroni salad. chicken salad on the croissant had similar opinions on the tuna that it was thick and over dressed but the croissant was toasted and good.\\n\\ni would definitely check this place out again, maybe for breakfast next time! i love that they do reward cards for locals to earn free sandwiches and even deliver within a 5 mile radius. i'll update after my next visit.\",\n",

              " ('7/15/17. came to vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and saturday just seemed to want us to be at encore beach club the entire day/night. first, we attended diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. we ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. the staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. the rave-booty was twerk-tacular. there were spankings. the bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. all i saw were smiles. you could see diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the dj. we danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. \\n\\nas more of my group came in from all over, we came back for marshmello saturday night (nightswim!), whom i hadn\\'t seen since edc last year. we got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we\\'d want a dry drinking spot haha. our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the vip even invited us into the small vip pool behind us. \\n\\nwe got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. i was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as i forgot to tell the bank i was leaving the state. my host alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while i called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. she was calm and pleasant, and simply said \"this happens all the time.\" (this was in stark contrast to the treatment at omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). \\n\\nalexia and her runner, damn i totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. she came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. they also made sure we stayed hydrated! super important when it\\'s 100 at night. they gave us just the right amount of attention and class. \\n\\nthank you guys, and special thanks to alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! truly i don\\'t expect anything less from encore/wynn (xs, surrender/encore beach club) - i never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that i have both attended with tickets and tables. they are the best, they will always be the best. \\n\\nthanks again! :-)',\n",

              " ('my husband and i used to order from here more than i\\'d like to admit (almost weekly). the pizza is pretty mediocre, but it\\'s really cheap and convenient. the cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. we always order online (which i love), it\\'s right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we\\'re that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. \\n\\nlast time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. we ordered cheesy bread, a philly sub, and onion rings. i asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.\\n\\ni paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). my husband showed up about 20 minutes after i ordered. not only wasn\\'t the food ready, but apparently they hadn\\'t even started it and were in no hurry. he waited almost another hour (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it\\'s about a one minute drive) to get our food. they didn\\'t comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. \\n\\nwhen we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. i\\'d waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. i hopped in the car because, as i said, it\\'s literally around the corner, and junk food just ain\\'t the same without ranch for dippin. \\n\\ni walked in. everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but i was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"i\\'ll be right with you.\" finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. i told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could i just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. now that may have been an excessive amount, but i had low blood sugar brain. and at this point i figured they\\'d throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they\\'d screwed up!). instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. why? i have no idea. but she said she was new, so i said fine. she went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who i assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can i help you, i was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who i was and what i ordered. he also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. it was like they all had amnesia! you don\\'t remember the tall skinny dude who just left after waiting for his order for an hour?! he told me what i ordered like i was on crack and what was the problem. i said yes, i know what i ordered, but i requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. again, he rudely asked me how many i wanted, incredulous i was asking. it was like the freakin inquisition. do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn\\'t get ranch with their orders?? he started taking containers out of the fridge. i was so upset by this point that i don\\'t even know what he said that prompted me say \"wow, you are really something else.\" there were four containers of ranch on the counter which i snatched while i could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they\\'re 75 cents a piece. i may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. \\n\\ni honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service i have ever received. it certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. i can\\'t believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. i worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.\\n\\ni realize no one cares or will ever read this. my husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but i was just so incredulous about the entire thing. it was cathartic. i feel better. though that will be of little comfort next time i want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.',\n",

(mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  we order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his grandma in colorado, and what it was like working after christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.\\n\\nwhen the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, \"do you know one thing thats missing in this place?\"  the server leaned in all interested.... \"napkins - there are no napkins on the table\".  our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  he stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, \"could we have napkins?\" - and there was this \\'oh yeah\\' moment - he was oblivious at times.\\n\\nso, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  the refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  we came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.\\n\\nthe kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  he told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  he asked us if we wouldn\\'t mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  \\n\\nok, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to improve and figure out where you are failing.  the fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are all issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  if i owned this place, i would be pissed off.   \\n\\nagain, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.',\n",

              " (\"so i've been coming here for years and have never had any issues until today. i ordered what i've always ordered. a bean burrito, a taco and a drink. it cost over $9 dollars!! the lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. she asked if i wanted a bean and cheese burrito. well obviously i said yes i want cheese in it. the price on the menu said it was like $2.50. there was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. so i pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. i said, i'm sorry how much?? so i'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. so i get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! there sign said $2 something. i pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. i went up and asked why i was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. he said because i got cheese in it. i said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? they always have and i've never been charged extra for it!! what place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? also, for the first time their taco was bad. i opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! usually it's nice and crispy/crunchy and this time was not. i told them their signs are wrong. also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! told them i will never be back!! i can get better food at taco bell and more food for the same price!! they don't false advertise there either! furious!  their food and prices have gone downhill fast! they lost mine and my family's business for good!!\",\n",

              " (\"awful awful people! i'm only giving them one star because i can't post otherwise, but they're not even worth that. i used movingapt.com to find them - won't ever use them again either. i thought having an agent would prevent this kind of crap from happening. i don't even know where to start with my complaints; this entire move was a mess from the beginning due to lack of communications and professionalism. i paid extra for a specific move date and time, as well as a 'special handling fee' because of my piano. \\n\\nwhen they arrive for the pick-up - 2 days late 6 hours after they were supposed to be there - they didn't come prepared for a piano. my dad and uncle had to find 2x4's to use as a ramp and help the movers hold it and roll it off the porch. this is a stage piano, the wheels aren't really meant for rolling around cement! after loading everything and telling my parents they were headed my way (virginia), my stuff is taken from wyoming to seattle, then back to vegas where it was put in storage without my knowledge or permission. i only found out because i kept calling to see the whereabouts of the truck so i could plan accordingly. after repeated phone calls, and finally the threat of legal action, my items were put back on a truck and started the journey east. \\n\\nfinally, they call to tell me they'll be there on june xx, which is exactly during the 3-day window i said i would be out of the state and not be able to receive the truck - again, all covered before the contract was even signed. so i'm told if i can't get a friend to meet them at my house and let them in, they'd go on to new york with my stuff and i'd have to pay an additional fee to get it, whenever they brought it back to me, which would be at their discretion. luckily, i was able to get a hold of someone and coordinate with them to receive the shipment, upon which he started taking pictures the moment the truck was opened. (see below). after they had unloaded everything and after i had confirmed 3 times over the course of this month that they had the proper equipment, they realize that in fact, they don't have anything to move the piano. so they decide they'll go to home depot, hire random men, and carry/lift the piano into my house. you don't lift a piano! so my friend that's there says no, it's too heavy, you need the proper equipment, i suggest you go find it. so then they tell him that they need to get on the road to new york for their next job so they'll just go put my piano in a warehouse until i was back so i'd let them deliver it. again, they're told no, at which point the driver calls me while i'm in the airport and says if i don't let them into my house i'd have to pay a second delivery fee. i told them not to leave the state with my piano and i'd call them right back - so i call my friend and ask what's going on; he gives me the scoop. i asked him if he'd run up the street - about 4 blocks from my house - and secure a storage unit that these guys could back the truck right up to the ramp, get the piano on a dolly and store it there for two days til i could get a professional. he said ok, and while i'm still on the phone, i hear him say exactly that to the driver. i call the driver back myself and say the same thing. i literally asked them to wait 15 minutes while we got this taken care of; he said ok. my friend leaves, gets the paperwork for a storage unit, comes back and these guys have unloaded the piano, rolled it down the sidewalk (no dolly), tried to lift it up my 4 steps, dropped it, eventually go it inside, and we're running to their truck when my friend gets back. they hadn't given him the inventory sheets or had him sign anything, so he hollers at them and runs after. he had to jump in his own vehicle to chase them down and cut them off before they stopped. at that point they gave him the paperwork - still not signed - and took off again. \\n\\nas soon as i got home that same evening i went right to the piano to take a look and started taking pictures. i called the driver and asked what had happened. he said nothing, everything was fine, no damage. i called bs and told him i'm standing in my living room looking at the damage. he hung up and i've never been able to get a hold of these people since.\",\n",

(which i hate) so disappointed.\\n- shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  so gross.\",\n",

(which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for valentine\\'s day you probably shouldn\\'t answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how \"hot\" her female coworker is.)  this was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren\\'t eavesdropping on personal info. most uncomfortable \"romantic\" evening of my life...\\n\\nnow to the food.  the valentine\\'s day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a \"salad\", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the new zealand rack of lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a chocolate creme brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of nero d\\'avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). we ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.\\n\\n\\nthe soup - lobster bisque (delicious) and minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. it was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). however it did taste quite nice.\\n\\nthe appetizer - artichokes with prosciutto.. yummo!\\n\\nthe salad - hmm not what i had in mind. a tiny plate of feta cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but not a traditional salad..so beware!  taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...this it is not.\\n\\nthe meal - veal with shrimp and gnocchi..quite pleasing to the palette.\\n\\nthe dessert - chocolate creme brulet...   umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of chocolate mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  yes it did taste good, however...where was the creme brulet the waiter raved about?\\n\\nthe wine - nero d\\'avola...yes i am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  but upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...why the lie? we would have ordered the special anyway...\\n\\nthe atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and christmas lights through out. they had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. the place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. the manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  by the time i left, my toes were frozen.\\n\\nwe finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. i turned around and noticed four empty 2 person tables. they had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple! \\n\\nupon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.\\n\\nwould i go back when in town again? no.  at the risk of being sat in that situation again.  the food can be the most delicious in the world, but i still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.\\n\\nand to the lady we sat next to...good luck on your birth, maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth.',\n",
