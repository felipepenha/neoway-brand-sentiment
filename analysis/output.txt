pretty awesome place to grab some beers and just hang out.

the patio was a great place to just chill with some friends.  parking is enormous.  bartenders friendly.  prices reasonable.  indoors has a nice ambiance to it and looks like a place that could be a staple if i lived nearby.

special shout-out to tyber for sponsoring our kickball team--drinkers with kicking problems!  okay, you get your fifth star...bribery works.

absolutely will never go here again, not only is it crowded to the point that people are shoulder to shoulder, but all the staff at the desk are rude and their manger was a complete dick head. i came in when they first opened and was interested for my parents and i. guy came out gave me a tour and then want to star the paper work. i told him that i gotta talk to my parents first and he made a comment saying;"your how old and you need to ask mommy and daddy!" well let's see my parents would have payed, and get the memberships but they where at a dr.appt and asked me to go and see if it's worth it. my parents went a head and got theirs because it was cheap and close to the house. as for me i'll prefer to go to 24 hour where weights can be dropped and i don't need to worry about some roided guy staring at me.

lv.net is without a doubt the superior choice in high-speed internet!! 
my only con is that i wish i had known about them sooner! after years of frustration with both cox and century link, i thought sub-standard internet service, terrible customer service, and ever-increasing monthly bills were my inescapable fate.
during my initial inquiry call, i was provided a thorough explanation of the services provided, along with pricing, and was able to schedule my installation that same week. the technicians sent were true professionals and worked diligently to have my internet up and running in a short amount of time. 
it's been five months now since upgrading to lv.net and my internet has never been better.  i can easily say it's been five months of dependable and reliable service! my teenage son is also a gamer, so the switch to lv.net has been a real game changer for him, his days of lag and limited connection are thankfully long gone.
the purpose of my review is to assure people that there is a better option for their internet needs! lv.net is a locally owned and operated business which means when you call their customer service you get to talk to a real person in town!!! not an automated machine, or a representative outsourced from another country, which is personally quite refreshing. 
we are living in a time of technology, and unlike my past providers, this company has demonstrated that they are ahead of the curve! i do the majority of my work from home, and being able to have a dependable internet connection with unrivaled upload & download speeds is life changing!

great movie theatre that shows second run films. tickets are generally $3 each and on tuesdays admission is only $1.50! i don't know about you, but that's a darn good deal! in addition to all the box office hits, they also on a fairly consistent basis show foreign films. some of the theatres have been upgraded with reclining leather seats. the rest of the theatres have the old school red cushion style chairs. this is an older theater, there are no stadium seats. however, for the price and for what you get- this is the best deal in town!

the only thing i wish for would be an occasional early/mid-morning matinee.. say about 11 or 11:30 am, so i'd have time to go before work. 

the restrooms are always clean, staff is always friendly, and the decor is outdated (think 1990's). although, i cannot comment on the food since i've never partook. i would recommend this theater for anyone on a budget, families, singles and friends- anyone really... and i will return!

love this nail salon. i happened to find this place since it's across the street from my kids preschool. i have been getting the sns manicure. it's better than gel, last twice as long and it has made my nails longer and healthier. the sns lasts 3-4 weeks and they still look great. could last longer except the growth is what finally gets me in to have them re-done. i have never once had a nail chip, lift or break. definitely worth trying if you are tired of getting gel nails every 2 weeks and gel always lifting and coming up

i looooooved living at the venetian for a weekend. although i shared the room with 6 smelly boys and 2 lovely girls, i thoroughly enjoyed our suite. the bathroom is gorgeous with two sinks, a separate vanity area, a big tub, and see-thru shower. my only complaint is room service. the morning after a very drunken night, i ordered a bottle of evian and a bottle of voss with slices of cucumber to be delivered to my room. the cost? thirty dollars. that was definitely one expensive hangover.

i recently moved back to scottsdale and was looking for a new esthetician. i did a little research online and came across celebrity skin. they have impeccable reviews with multiple satisfied customers, so i decided to schedule an appointment. just to clarify, there are two jennifers so it can get a bit confusing. jennifer s. (the owner), and jennifer f. jennifer f was available on the day and time that was convenient for me so i decided to schedule with her. i could not be happier with the service! she was so meticulous, knowledgable and took time to understand my skins needs and concerns. i'm so happy it only took me one attempt to find my new esthetician.

after attending the gnr show, while having had a great time at a fantastic show, i have to admit the arena itself was nothing spectacular.  as a matter of fact, it was pretty standard.  for being in a place like las vegas, i would have expected something a little more interesting or themed or just more grand to catch the vibe of the strip.  this venue did the job, acoustics were fine, parking was fine, beer selection was fine, seats were fine...basically everything was just fine.  i guess that is my problem, in las vegas, a place where anything goes...it should be more than just "fine", it should be larger than life.  mark missed, simple as that.

laura was incredible. i bought my house and was delayed in getting it rekeyed. i finally got around to it and she was recommended by my realtor. she came out a few hours after i called and was quick and efficient in changing every lock and making sure i was safe in my home. she took extra measures she didn't have to for my benefit and i am incredibly grateful! 

laura the lock lady is an absolute gem in a world that i didn't know much about. and it's nice to see powerhouse women who excel in a male dominated field! keep on rockin on, lock lady!

botanical garden was a nice stroll for the family. we took the tram to tree center. they chinese garden was closed but we saw some of the pretty lantern outside. it was a shame that it was closed. we also went to the japanese garden but nothing to compared to the chinese garden. we also liked the insectarium, got to hold a cucaracha.  saw so many different bug species. the roses and water lilies were beautiful. it was a warm day but they had water fountain everywhere to keep hydrated.

this is the only place we will take our portuguese water dog to get groomed. arturo spent time understanding what we wanted and more importantly, what our dog could handle while getting groomed. she doesn't like blow driers so he accommodated her by letting her air dry rather than forcing her to finish sooner. simple things like this make a huge difference i believe.

i can't sing higher praises of these guys.  my 30k mile versa had developed an idling problem.  i took my car in for routine maintenance and asked if they would have a look at the problem.  they performed the routine maintenance i requested and although i was a little bit taken aback by the price for the inspection ($100-$200 based on what they had to do) i have trusted them for quality service on other vehicles.  they did a diagnostic and the problem was a misfire on cylinder 2.  they went out of their way to call my dealership to see if the problem was covered under warranty, which it was.  as it turned out nissan had to replace my engine.  this mechanic could have chased the problem from sensor to sensor and fuel filter and ignition etc etc but they didn't, they found the correct path for me to save money and get my car running perfect again.  after that matt who is the friendliest and most helpful person you will ever meet at a mechanic offered to take my car to the dealership and pick it up for me, free of charge.  he even knocked off most of the inspection charge because they quickly realized they wouldn't be doing the work to repair it.  there are cheaper mechanics out there but the quality of service here not only made my experience much better but ended up saving me potentially thousands of dollars worth of repairs that were ultimately covered under my warranty.

although there is a small premium to get work done here (there are shady mechanics that will do jobs for less) the customer service by itself, let alone the quality of work, honesty and integrity of the staff are well worth the marginal pricing differences.  

keep up the good work!  always glad to support local businesses!

i will never come to this store again, and i will never give either store my business again. i used to always go to the one up on thunderbird and never really had a problem with how the animals were kept.. with the exception of the guinea pigs and rabbits being in large troughs on the floor within reach of children that don't necessarily know how to respect animals & having animals that are being boarded within reach of the public as well. besides that, i had no complaints and the staff were always wonderful there. about 3 weeks ago, i went to the glendale branch and was appalled. upon walking in, they have baby chicks in towers with feed trays surrounding the outside of them for them to stick their heads through to eat.. only one of the chicks had escaped the pen and was teeter on the edge on one of the high feed platforms. alarmed i ran over and asked my boyfriend to stand by it to make sure it didn't fall while i went and got a staff member. i grabbed a young man who seemed less than interested in what i just told him and was incredibly non-chalet. i then walked out to the back part outside where there were goats/pigs/peacocks ect. there were too many animals crammed into one pen and one worker was hosing (with a garden hose) down the pigs and goats to keep them cool (as az summers are 115). there's no reason to keep so many animals in one pen, especially in this kind of heat. i was not at all fond of common pigeons being for sale for $2.00 either. overall, after my experience at the glendale location, i don't want pratt's to have my business at all because animal welfare is clearly not a top priority there. very disappointing.

i began using the east parking area when i would travel a lot for work. now that i don't travel for work, i do travel a bit for pleasure. i always opt for the parking garage (b). my car is in a covered area, close to the sky train and to the 202. i am in charge of getting my car and getting home. i don't have to wait for a bus to pick me up and take me somewhere of site. i always advise people to use sky harbor parking.

who knew that the people working here were paid to make fun of those who didn't speak french? 
i certainly didn't when i stopped in to order some food on a regular friday night. 

to management: i hope you seriously take a look at who you hire in the future.  even though i don't speak french, my friend certainly did, and didn't appreciate how your staff rudely made fun of me for not speaking it. they're paid to do their job, take orders, and make food, not give their opinions on their customers. 

to future customers: spend your money elsewhere unless you want to be rudely berated. an absolutely disgusting example of montreal customer service. 

so glad i didn't end up spending money here after they insulted me. i will never spend money at another amir restaurant ever again.

eh. idk why people come here so often, there are other places to get real bagels people! im pretty sure everything here is frozen, if not it sure tastes like it is. this place doesn't need our money. try going to a local business with authentic bagels instead of this rich low-quality chain that makes the same bagel here as it does in its nyc locations. i doubt any new yorkers would waste their money on these wannabe bagels. kind of lowers the standards for the american bagel, but if you like cheap quality food like mcdonald's then this place is for you

they do have the best selection of tennis anything in the valley. prices are standard - but the selection is so extensive it makes the drive worthwhile. customer service is always mediocre - dh prefers to shop at tennis warehouse because they have exceptional customer service. i like to keep my dollars local, but to be frank, they make it a hassle. if their service matched their selection they would be amazing!

purchased a groupon and was assigned to amy for a 90 minute therapeutic massage i believe it is amy m. she didn't excellent job and i would highly recommend. i had the best neck massage and mild traction. my neck felt wonderful all day.  the spa is extremely clean and feels like going to the four seasons. everything is nice and quiet peaceful tranquil. i do have to give a shout out to amy for being so professional and stating that this was my time to relax and that she was going to be quiet now. it is so difficult when you go to massage places that the massage therapist is so chatty that you can't relax. i had a great massage. 
 my massage was 9 am and i actually had just woke up went for massage felt like it fall back asleep again and then went home and took a nap for an hour and a half. i have not been sleeping well lately so this was such a treat to feel so relaxed that i was able to take a nap. thank you

service advisor dustin was very helpful and courteous helping get our first oil change for our 2014 honda civic as we were getting ready to drive to colorado soon as this car had 5,700 miles on it as i could have gone the next day to honda west where i purchased the car but wanted to get the oil change done already before my wife and i go on our trip to denver. i think that we might have overpaid for the oil change with pep boys cause i got an email from honda west for an oil change for $29.95 which i believe i was overcharged quite a bit even though i got $15.00 off using my pep boys rewards card. i would very much like to have some money coming back to me. thanks for your time

not the best stay ever. shower took 10 min to heat up. internet was moving at a snails pace and then stopped working completely. i'm writing this review on my phone now...also room service is expensive. i'm talking 12.5 for a wedge salad. i've had a long trip and didn't want to go out but those prices are crazy.

would like to add that the front desk is very accommodating and very nice.

pro
-nice towels (they actually absorb water!)
-location in ohio city
-few minutes to subway
-free parking
-decent prices!

neg
-shower was not cleaned when we checked in at 8 pm; soap grime and hair in shower (individual room, not shared bathroom)
-pillow case reeked of the past nights cologne, this guy overdid it!!!
-one of the hottest summers (2016) and room was at different times warm/hot (especially for sleeping), bought a cheap fan at walmart (which helped but was inconvenient)
-better suited for younger (30 and under), can be loud (rent spaces for parties, etc).
-bed was hard/not comfortable
-if you are spending the extra for your own bathroom/singular room throw a tv in the room, especially help with all the hall noise
-being asked to join a yoga class on the small rooftop for $10, we just wanna check out the view.

rooftop is a nice touch, not as breathtaking as others claimed.  personally we had no interest in shared kitchen, if you are looking too cook, etc; a big plus!

melinda murphy was literally sent into my life at precisely the right time to sell my condo.  it was extremely emotional and high risk for me, and i was so confused i could not make good decisions, if any. 

she took great time and effort to explain things in a way i could understand, possibly helped by her long time experience as an aa big book sponsor.  

she calmed me down and explained everything in detail, what needed to be done, how, when, and provided a specialty photographer who took flattering pictures.

it sold in 2 1/2 weeks !!!  she networked the listing everywhere and then got the buyer to drop all but 2 issues easily with a simple $500 toward repairs.  it closed 8/11/116 and i am sure it would still be sitting dead on the phx market at much less if i had a different realtor.

i highly recommend melinda as your realtor because of my experience as a seller who was totally paralyzed with fear over what could happen in the wrong hands.

ross is one of those discount stores that hit or miss. sometimes you find great deals and sometimes the place is just trashed.  i roll the dice every time i hit a ross.  but today, here to get some shirts for my son, the only person actually friendly with the staff was the security guard who "welcomed" us into the store.  murielle, the checker, may have been having a bad day but she was not friendly at all.  yelling very aggressively "next in line" not in a high volume so customers can hear but more aggressive like irritated she had to check out the line of people waiting.  once there she didn't address us and removed the hangers from the clothes by tossing them onto the counter, even hitting my hand as i was leaving on the counter.  then asking cash or card, irritably and then screamed next in line after i began paying.  as i was paying she finished bagging up the clothes and tossed them at me. covering my hand again as i was putting my numbers into the debit machine.   i'll try to avoid this store in the future, no reason for any employee of any kind of store to treat customers so aggressively and irritably.  thanks for the couple of discounted shirts ross i'll spend the extra doe and go somewhere else where i get treated like a human.

i visited the barber of choix recently and was very impressed. i got a shave and a haircut. i had never had a straight razor shave and the experience is great. it's very much like the old-style shave you see in movies with the relaxing chair, the hot towel, the mug shave-cream, the straight razor and then the after shave. the whole experience was very relaxing and fun. i would definitely recommend it.

i used to think that this place only sold winter type clothes but how ignorant of me! now a days, i find any excuse to shop here. 

i recently bought a snowboarding jacket, snow pants, gloves andddddd a hydroflask lid, all for an affordable price! good quality too! very warm, many layers. 

something i obsess about and have one in almost every color are the thinner jackets. perfect for a semi cold weather, the rain or to wear as a top layer.  they usually have a discount on almost all their items so even more of an excuse to binge shop. 

they even have lunch bags, scarves, luggages, hydroflask, bandanas, hats, etc. basically outdoor adventure type gear. 

staff at this location are all behind the counter and none of the floor. once in a while i see some step out to help consumers but they should do it more often especially when there's so many foreign people shopping there.

tip: if you're looking for something specific, call first and be prepared to wait a long time on the phone. there isn't an easy way for them to look something up. i guess it depends on how much you want it!

over the past 30 years i have bought and sold several houses. i never got the sense the realtors deserved their commissions. not until sandy sold a townhouse for me did i experience a realtor with the dedication, enthusiasm and knowledge that commands respect and gratitude. 

sandy don't play. she is all business all the time. i appreciated her intelligent, no-nonsense focus on my sale. with multiple offers, she helped me navigate my way to a completed sale in 90 days; and that was during a dip in the market.  the other factor was that everything was done long distance because i live out of state and never met her. 

with sandy you get a twofer: she is both a realtor and an appraiser.  what more can you ask for?

i came here with my husband and a few of his business partners. there was a convention in town so the only reservation i could get was for 8:30 which was very early for vegas. we wer the only ones in the restaurant as we were seated. we started off with dirty martinis and they were made to perfection. the waiter was attentive, explained the menu and answered any of our questions. we ordered a little bit of everything and there was nothing that we did not like. as the night went on, a few more martinis we got a little louder but the waiter kept up with us. at the end of the night the chef even brought us a sample of desserts and took  a picture with me. can't wait to go back. great 5 star experience!

read their reviews and looked up their website.  4 of us showed up today for brunch to a completely empty restaurant.  we asked for the table in front next to the window.  next thing we knew the rude hostess was ushering us to outside seating.  note: it is cloudy and raining today.  the group consisted of 4 / 3 women in their 50's and 60's.  no one was interested in sitting outside on a day like this.  we again asked for the table inside the empty restaurant and she then told us that they were completely booked.  it was completely empty.  i am assuming it was booked for a party or something, but shouldn't you post that on your facebook page or on your website?  it was handled poorly by their staff and especially the hostess.  would not even consider returning.  guess what folks... great restaurants are a dime a dozen here in the valley.  we walked without even looking back.

food was amazing and don't get me wrong about service. the waitress who waited us was wonderful. but the person who seated us was a little rude. we have 3 kids under 7yrs old and they were pretty excited about the place but then when they were seating us the person seating us yelled at our kids and said that they needed to quite down but for us our kids weren't very loud compared to those who were in the restaurant yelling swear words drunk. hype person who seated us said to our kids there is no yelling, no cursing and no getting crazy. i was furious but didn't make a statement because i know our kids wouldn't do that and they know not to be rude and yell out bad words. they were being kids excited to eat. like said, food was great but probably not was a great idea taking kids.

i loved my stay at this hostel. it was right on the edge of kensington market and next to university of toronto. there is a night club right next door to this hostel. 

the staff was very friendly and the fellow backpackers were all very welcoming. the common areas of the hostel allowed for great conversations and meeting of interesting people. 

the beds were good and clean. lockers were provided in the bedrooms but you must bring your own lock. there was a nice balcony area but the view is not always something special. mine overlooked a sitting between the surrounding buildings. 

bathrooms are clean and nice. one of the showers had a torn curtain but other than that everything was very modern and sleek in appearance. 

in the kitchen, there is plenty of space for you to store your own food.

has an atmosphere for quietly reading or doing some work. not a place you would want to bring friends to hangout in just because this location is pretty small. but it has a very warm and cozy touch to it.

this is a great place if you are interested in glass work.  this includes stained glass, flamework (bead making), fusing (melting glass), and glass blowing.  their fusing center is open whenever the store is open with lots of little projects available from about $5 to about $50.  they also have classes ranging in the $50 to $300 range.  i've taken the flamework bead making class...twice.  i've also done the blown glass ornaments class.  fusing classes i've tried include the fused strips bowl (twice), fused jaws bowl (twice), and hanging air plant holder.  there are more i want to try too...when i can fit them into my schedule.

the staff is helpful, and super talented...stop in to see their work, available for purchase too.

my wife and i come here often, but after today's experience, we might have to find another place for vietnamese food. the food is good and the prices are decent. however, the service here is a hit or miss, and lately it has been absolutely horrible. our orders often come out incorrect or items are missed despite pointing to the item on the menu when ordering. at first, we thought it was because they are busy, but there weren't that many dinners tonight and this seems to be the norm based on our past few experiences here.

first of all i been a loyal cora customer,  i been coming to them almost every other sunday with my family 

went here last sunday. 

the service overall was pretty bad.   waitress was super rude and was rushing us to order.  even though restaurant was not busy as i normally have seen them.   she had one other table beside ours.   we were so upset that we ask her not to serve us.  completely ruin our time there. 

we had ordered 3 dishes...  my dad's was the last to get his and there was a 10 minute time difference from the time i got mine and him getting his. the portions have shrunk,  barely got any home fries. 

we won't be returning to this coras again. and i will forward this to their head office.   they need to train their staff and do some quality control...  i hope this review turns off people from going here.

some of the doctors will do a sales pitch with you and try to provoke fear inside of you to get your animals unnecessary treatment they don't need. you have to really know your shit yourself so you know to take their advice with a grain of salt and only stick to what you know your animal needs. there was a black doctor that took care of us and you could tell that he was lying and not comfortable with it.  i have done work in timeshare sales so i know all about trying to create fear and urgency and all that crap in people and he was trying to do it to me so it was quite amusing.  it's really sad that it's almost impossible to get honest people with integrity to advise you on medical help for yourself and your animal in this country but that's capitalism for you.

on the one hand, i love gp and on the other, it's gotten obscenely expensive.  there are affordable shoes, but they are mostly canvas runners and the treton wellies. i only buy things there if they're on sale now. occasionally there's a find (notably chie miharas and marc jacobs under $100). but if they're going higher end, i'd like to see a bit more effort with the hig-end stuff. why are there no viv westwoods? and when did they shift from the quirky campers to the boring ones my mom picks up and tells me are "nice"?

this restaurant is (almost)  literally a whole in the wall! i live very close and walked by without even noticing the restaurant. the awning sign out front did not entice me to give a second look. i was brought by a friend and was shocked when i walked inside. it's a really stylish, cool space. the people working there are young and very friendly. the food is cooked to order and so good. i got the bim bim bab (bop?). i have been back since and love this place. their prices are reasonable, but eating in is a challenge - it's tiny. if you're in the neighbourhood, check it out - and if you're not, it's worth the trip.

plenty of parking here. they don't take reservations, and due to it's popularity expect a wait time to be seated. definitely a place if you're looking for affordable sushi. i favor the crab, tiger, and haru popper rolls.

the selection of stores is okay. i came here mainly for the nike factory outlet. i came out with a vegas knights license plate frame from a small hockey shop.

inside the food court, there was an easter bunny that your kids could take pictures with. unfortunately it did not have any specific hours or days that he was there but i was there on a thursday.

having been to many other tgifridays i can say this was the worst i've seen.  service was subpar.  having to ask three times for silverware is not acceptable.  food took forever and came cold.  the portions were definitely smaller than other locations.  prices way too high for poor quality.  bathrooms filthy.  there are much better choices in the area.

my calamari was so so. my issue is with the professionalism of the staff.  when my change was brought to me the waitress said it is a dollar short because they ran out of change. she didn't say "when i get the change i will bring it to you", or "do you have a dollar and i will trade you a five?" she took it upon herself to keep it. i was busy talking to friends so until i counted my change did we understand what she was telling us.  my friend said,"did i just hear what i thought i heard"?

the money is not the issue, it is the way it was handled and the attitude of matter of fact.

this had nothing to do with a tip since they already had added 20%. truthfully i usually give 25%.

found this place thanks to yelp when i had s conference at a local hotel. i didn't want hotel food so made the short drive to the food truck randomly parked at a gas station. two tacos, rice and beans later, i was in heaven and for under $10. such a great find.

food's good but the waiters are way too laid back and even impolite at times.

one waiter is looking insistently at my girlfriend. not that i am jealous or that i lack confidence but they shall know when to behave like they are in a bar and when to behave like they are at work. i went twice there and the same waiter was intensively checking out female customers every time.

the other waiter wouldn't take my order properly as he was standing very far from me when taking notes (like i was apparently supposed to shout at him to say what i wanted). he did dare arguing with me that i shall have said something as soon as i noticed that he wasn't proposing me the proper sauces accompanying my meal...

it's the french school of waiting, where being impolite is accepted. the difference is that, in france, tipping 15% of the bill is not the norm. i'm waiting for much more coming from a supposedly chic establishment (at last when one looks at the prices).

montreal does not lack of good restaurants with servers providing great service. i'm definitely not going back to lemeac before a long time.

i called homeowners financial group to do a simple refinance and now that it's finished i feel like i am in a worse position than when i started.  initially the loan officer was very nice and worked with me on all options. after i agreed to go ahead is when i started feeling like i made a mistake. it seemed as if the loan officer was on her own and didn't find things out till the last minute.  first it was the appraisal that needed to be done yesterday.  after the appraisal i was informed on a friday that i needed to complete a very minor repair by monday morning which resulted in me cancelling plans i had made out of town. the appraiser showed up and snapped one picture. a week later i get another $200 charge on my credit card from him which brought the total appraisal fee to $700. for as trivial as the repair was it makes me think that this might be a common practice to gouge the customer. maybe the appraiser is related to someone at homeowners? i don't know?  

when it came time to close there was no information on who was going to service my loan. i had a month before my payment was due and i was never contacted by phone or by mail. finally i called them to ask if they would like my money and where should i send it, they did not know.  during this whole time i received letter after letter from multiple "bi-weekly payment program" companies they must have sold my information to. i gave it another couple days and called them back and asked again. they said a company called rcs would be servicing my loan and to send a check. first off it is 2015 and i don't have any checks because i haven't written one in 5 years. second, even if i had a check it would not be there by the due date. i then tried calling the service number for rcs and it is 100%automated. called homeowners financial again and they finally gave me a number to an actual person at rcs who told me i wouldn't even be in the system until the due date and i would be charged a $5 fee for making that payment  which again made me feel like my wallet has been ganged up on by these people. absolute confusion followed up by fees. 

 in hindsight it was not worth the hassle and i am missing the ease of my initial mortgage. unexpected fees and  horrible loan servicing, i wouldn't refer them to anybody.

we came in after a flight into las vegas. the server spent a ton of energy trying to get us to fill out an online survey about her. she even went as far as to tell us what to write. it was an awkward moment  when she asked us if we had completed it yet to get our $5 off. 

the food was ok, nothing to write home about. i would say more about the food then the staff. the meal was spoiled by the regular survey questions from our server.

overall, i like the workout i get here.  i've been attending their early morning classes for about 20 days (just finished their intro deal), and so far so good. be aware they are very strict on their start and stop times, so allow for a little extra time to get there just in case your clock doesn't quite match with theirs. their staff also seem very knowledgeable about what they do here, and are approachable if you have concerns. each class is very consistent and is taught the same way, so, for example, if you come in for topaz it'll be the same class no matter who teaches it. i've seen some people on here complain about that, but i personally like that so that i know what kind of class i'm coming in for that day.

update: 7/29/2016
so in the time i've been working out at arrichion, i have to say my opinion of the place could only improve!  i've been attending their classes consistently for about 2.5 years now, and thanks to arrichion, i officially fell in love with yoga, got my ryt200 certification, and now get to teach yoga to little kids at my kids' daycare!  i also dropped from a size 14 to a size 6 and have toned up in a way i haven't been since high school!  the owners and staff here truly love what they do every day and it shows!  you truly can't beat the heat here either...it's the hottest yoga studio in town! 
the only significant drawback here is the lack of showers. there is only one small shower room that everyone has to share. in the evening when you can go home stinky it doesn't matter so much, but in the morning right before work showering is a must. luckily i can keep the workouts i love at arrichion and use other options closer to work to take care of the shower. :)

i have been going here for almost 3 years.  over the last year my dog has hesitated every time i start to go in.  pulls away not wanting to go.  i noticed the haircuts were not as good.  same person grooming all the time, very uncaring.  last time was the final straw, cut his whiskers and eyelashes.  she actually shaved the hair by his eyes so close you could see his skin. .

the north beats the south in this one. the outlet here is closer to you if you are staying on the south side of the strip but if you can, make the trek up to the north outlets. it has improved a lot since i last came when it was the belz outlet center so it's getting there but not up the standards of the north.

the shops are pretty plentiful. remember to check in at the guest services center for a free coupon box. (could be handy if you plan on splurging) the whole complex is a mish mosh of stores. not as high end as the ones in the north but there are some decent ones. there seemed to be a lot of empty shops as well.  get your walking shoes on because it is one long straight path from the top to the bottom. if you want more shopping, there is an outside promenade with some more shops!

so get your shop on. it's aite but if you have the time and the money, i'd hit up the north ones afterwards or instead.

i normally don't edit these reviews but i wanted to follow-up with my latest experience this afternoon.

i returned this afternoon because since this latest restring i have experience an unusual amount of movement in the main strings. very frustrated with this, i wanted to see what could be done to fix this. 

the most viable solution seemed to be putting on a thicker string, but i still can't figure out why the play is so dramatically different from the prior 2 stringings. 

still, i appreciate that the manager seemed to have been reading yelp and asked me to correct one issue he had with my review. 
apparently, the store was able to restring (the 2nd time) the racquet the same day, but simply neglected to call and notify me. 

i should note that he offered to restring the racquet with a thicker main string (i use natural gut on the cross strings) for $20. that seems to be their cost for the string (which is really pricy and needs to be replaced in both directions). as i hadn't budgeted the $20, i will have to put it off or forego it until the next string. $70+tax for a restringing is really eating into my pocket money.

my new star rating is 3.5 stars, rather than 3 as indicated above. to be sure, i am a tough reviewer so 4 seems too high at this point, but it is not impossible so long as the store continues to improve their customer service and we see some improved planogramming. as a steady customer, i am looking forward to seeing the progress.

i would add another insight that i hadn't mentioned before. i really think the store has a good demo racquet program. for $30, they will let you swap out 2 demo racquets at a time for 30 days. at the end of the program, you get that same $30 off of the purchase of the racquet (in-store not online).

the only limitation to the program is that you need to put on your own overgrips to get an optimal feel for the racquet. also, you don't get to choose the strings that go on the demo racquets (obviously), so you aren't necessarily going to get a perfect idea of how the racquet will play after you get it. still, if you are a beginner player, strings may not matter so much to you.

additionally, wilson the us open tennis balls are competitively priced at $2.39 each + tax and the selection of over grips and strings seems to be at least as good if not better than other stores i have visited. additionally, if you research prices on their site and they do not match the in-store price, they are happy to honor the online price. not bad for a brick-and-mortar.

the original review:

"i have very mixed feelings about this place. on the one hand, the prices for many (but certainly not all) products are competitive (even versus most web sites), which is nice to have locally. their sale items are usually not amazing. not a great place to go for sales, in my experience.

on the other hand, you have to put up with an inexperienced, sometimes rude staff. it's a bit like going to one of those hole-in-wall/diamond-in-the-rough barbecue places. 

by inexperienced, i don't mean to say the owner/employees don't know tennis. they know that pretty well- more so than say a big box store. what i mean to express is that they are inexperienced with customer service.

a recent example would be a re-string i had done there. all about tennis stores re-string information in the computer, which makes for a simplified process when dropping off your racquet. because they don't always re-string your racquet right away, they store the information that includes your preferences. so last week i dropped my racquet off and told them i wanted the usual hybrid string setup. my father had to pick the racquet up 2 days later, as i didn't have the availability to pick it up myself (they close very early - 6pm, which is too early for a retail store). he brought the racquet home and i discovered immediately that the wrong strings had been put on it. so i called the store and they said to bring it by to fix the mistake. so i brought it back the next day, and they had me leave it again because they couldn't get back to it. the worst part of this experience was that when i took the racquet back, the owner/manager got into an argument with me saying that he had simply "put the same strings on as had been taken off". an obvious lie which serves no good for him. indeed, his own staff (much younger) advised him that he had indeed put the wrong strings on the racquet. (by the way, these strings look nothing alike, so i cannot fathom how this mistake was made!)

so 5 days and a $55 restring - i'm not too happy about the poor customer service, so i will start looking for someone else to restring my racquet. at the very least they should be comping the labor for their screw up, especially considering all the drive time, gas, etc. that this debacle has cost me.

separately, the showroom could do with a little sprucing up. wouldn't take much i think, but some elbow grease would go a long way."

not only is this bar super cool and fun, but last night i lost my wallet there with over 500$ in it (yes i know i was stupid for having that much cash on me), and someone turned it in to staff who then called me and i had it returned with all the money still in it. they wouldn't even accept any reward money and even did a free shot with me when i went in to pick it up. not only was it amazing that someone at the bar turned it in, but the staff totally could have been like "let's split this money and tell her it was taken". kudos to your amazing staff, i'm so thankful. good vibes all around at this place!!!

culligan total water treatment systems is really a great company to work with and i love their service! 

we have one of their products at work (a counter-top, plumbed water cooler) that was having some issues. i called in and spoke to the nicest gentleman who was able to get me through to who i needed to talk to, and then reed was able to get a tech out the very same day. that's almost unheard of! 

the tech who showed up was very friendly and knowledgeable and was able to get our older machine swapped out quickly. i was very impressed at how efficient he was. 

the service is great. the product is great. and the price is great! no complaints. definitely recommend!

i am delighted i found this place. i have been wanting for years to get some med-spa treatments for my aging face, but have never been able to afford it. the pricing of these student-applied procedures is very reasonable and they also offer discounted specials several times throughout the year for additional savings. i've become a regular here since november of '14 and have already had a number of services for just a few hundred dollars that would have easily cost me in the thousands at a regular med-spa.

yes, the procedures are done by people who are still learning, so you need to be flexible and ready to accept some inconsistencies in the delivery of service. but it's a total win-win. the students gain real-world experience and you gain a better complexion. i certainly have!

so far, all of the student aestheticians have been women and they have been competent, friendly, fun and dedicated to doing a good job. they are seniors who have nearly completed the program and are thoroughly supervised by instructors who seem very knowledgeable. also, since it's a school, they adhere very strictly to standards of cleanliness and proper procedures. if they err, it's more on the side of being careful. i have not had a bad experience.

the only down sides for me are these: first, i've had service done by some gals with whom i was so happy, i would like to have a permanent working relationship with them. sadly, while you are able to request repeat appointments with a student while they are still enrolled, they do eventually graduate and move on.

this leads to the second down side which is, you can't really establish a history with any one provider and you frequently have to start over from scratch in discussing your skin-care history and goals. as a result of this i've also gotten some conflicting advice regarding which and what frequency of services would best meet my needs. but hey, it's a school and i am using it as a learning experience, too, so i can make better use of the available services. also, the medical director of swina, dr. laree hooker, has a private practice and, for the price of an office visit, you can make an appointment with her if you want professional advice in creating a treatment plan for yourself.

overall, i recommend this facility without reservation. give them a try!

we have used bark 'n' go for several months now to provide a self-service bath to our husky/lab mix. 

the facilities are great, and offer everything you need in one convenient location. the staff are warm, friendly and helpful and we have never had a bad experience. 

the price is very competitive and worth the price as opposed to attempting to give him a bath at home.

this is a long overdue review.   max automotive is the best place you can take your vehicle to for repairs.   we had recently taken our 2001 explorer to a local dealership to look at and they quoted us over 2k to fix a supposedly broken condenser.   we were in a pinch and couldn't afford to shell out that much prior to a road trip to california with my family.   i reached out to max and they were super helpful and got us in right away and quickly found out that the issue had nothing to do with the condenser and was simply a case of replacing some manifold hoses that were leaking.  600 bucks later we were good to go!  these guys are first class honest folks who go the extra mile to help you.   i would highly recommend them to any of my friends in a heart beat.  thanks guys for helping fix our vehicle!

i have tried many services in charlotte where i am paying 30-40 an hour to get my house dusted , vacuumed and the occasional toilet paper art. two hours cost me 90 and then i had to clean the other 2000 square feet of my house, 
    today that changed robert came to me from homejoy and cleaned my house, he mopped my floors with an actual mop something i have been begging cleaners here to do for years. scrubbed my bathrooms and kitchen, wiped down the baseboards, sucked up 100 lbs of dog fur and actual cleaned my house, he didn't tidy it up he cleaned it. as a man he is also able to move furniture clean under it, 
    i can dust and sweep in between visits but when i pay some to clean i want it clean and now that i have found robert, i know that my house will be clean

however my rating of homejoy as a company is terrible. a start up that exploits local people desperate for working taking half the hourly rate for themselves, providing no supplies, no training and no vacuum etc. each cleaner is an independent contractor, corp talk for 1099 no taxes paid, no insurance, no workman's comp etc. they set up a server and a regional coach hire anyone out of craigslist and send them out to clean your house. the business itself adds nothing to local economy or area, it is a shark tank winner and was gifted 38 million by google.
would i use them again never would i use the indie contractor they sent yes and i would pay him a decent fair wage

mixed feelings about this place. we ordered a recliner about 10 or so years ago. it still works perfectly well and has really held up - no sagging, all mechanicals working properly. i gave it to my children when they moved out as i want a power recliner and that one had the bar on the side. they had a 30% off power and leather sale recently. since the chair i wanted now was both power and leather, i went in to see if i could get what i wanted. the power chairs with the different motors for adjusting lumbar and head as well as legs and back are wonderful and this is the only place i know that has those options. but you will pay dearly for that comfort. the chair i ended up with was over $2000, tax and delivery included, even with the 30% off sale! i'm waiting for it to be delivered because it is semi-custom but i anticipate it being comfortable. however, the reasons for the lesser star rating is some of their wacky policies. since this is a chair, we were going to save money ($70) by picking it up in my husband's truck. if you go that route, they will still charge you $39 to have it delivered to the store. what? why? that is ridiculous. when you discuss (argue) these silly policies, they pretty much just shrug their shoulders and say "company policy" as if they have absolutely no control - and maybe they don't. because they are corporate owned now (changed over two years ago according to store manager), they will not (cannot?) negotiate costs for anything. i asked if they had a warehouse where we could pick it up for free. no. also, even if i paid the $39 and picked it up myself, i'd have to sign off on it (after inspecting it in the store). if i bring it home and put it together myself and then have a problem, i'm out of luck since i signed off that it was perfectly fine. um no, not doing that so i paid the money for delivery. very bad business practice and nothing to be done about it!  the next reason for the lower star rating is their policy for custom orders. their pricing policies are really arcane! i really wanted a bright red leather for my new chair and they offered it in a lower grade leather than the standard one on the chair i ordered. but even though it was a lower grade leather, it wasn't an included leather option for this chair so the custom price was $500 more for a lesser quality leather. huh? they really make it almost impossible to make your order custom without paying through the nose (which i'm already doing - $2000 for a chair?)!  apparently there's a set of fabrics/leathers for each model chair that you can choose as semi-custom for that chair without changing the price much. but go outside that standard set and you're going to pay a lot for the privilege. i decided on the wine colored red that didn't cost me any more money. definitely not what i wanted but acceptable. the staff was friendly. because they don't work on commission, they don't hassle you but they also aren't running to meet you at the door to help you out. overall, i'm hoping i'll be happy with this purchase because i'll be able to make adjustments to my chair to make it most comfortable for me but i'm paying a lot for that and not getting everything that i wanted. hence my mixed feelings and 3 stars instead of 5.

so, once upon a time i fancied myself a rocker. i had the requisite black hair in jr high school, the ripped t-shirts, etc. i outgrew the phase like most people do, grew out my hair , started easing up on the teen angst. but deep inside i believed that i could still hold my own, so that if i walked into a punk show i could still rock out with the best of them. thanks to the distillery, i now know that is a lie. i am not even close to hardcore, and i never ever was. i'm at peace with this.

we were heading somewhere completely different but walked by when someone suggested we go in. for some reason i did, and  due to a mis-communication half of us had paid to get in while half refused to go in and left. those that wouldn't actually are more hard core, and that speaks to how the rest of the night went. the people were fairly rude, jostling everybody and giving the outsiders dirty looks. definitely a hard crowd. everyone looked like they'd stepped off the cover of a rancid album. lots of scowls. they had a tiny circle pit, as everyone was too busy affecting coolness to join in. the band was awful and the cover overpriced considering. we finished our beers and left to rejoin with the smarter group. 

yep, not hardcore at all! phew, close call!

i didn't think that this was going to be all of that special and i can say that i pretty much went to appease my wife. sure, i was a little curious, but it was 99% to not start a fight. well, i was pleasantly surprised! this is actually pretty awesome. it's free and after 8pm it's every 15 minutes so the wait didn't bother me in the least. if you're on the strip after nightfall you should definitely check it out.

service was meh - now mind you, it was during the phoenix film festival, but the festival is 2 weeks, so management could have staffed better.

also, the food was bland and texture was off.  i always clean my plate.  not this time.  might be back, to try again, but with all the options nearby prob not.

the restaurant was clean, and the layout was good.

look at the unit you will be moving into not the model prior to signing anything. broke my lease early only after acouple months due to an ongoing roach problem. management insisted multiple foggings would resolve the issue but they kept coming back. instead of moving out i tried to see about management moving me to another unit but they would not work with me whatsoever. at one point, i came home after a fogging and maintenance had moved literally everything around (i'm talking the big appliances) without bothering to put anything back. sure i get everything has to be moved and theres a waiting period but i found it extremely disrespectful that no one thought about returning after the waiting period to out back the heavy items. the appliances had been lifted a pretty significant distance from the wall and dealing with lower back issues moving it back alone was rough. i eventually got tired of waking up with at least one roach crawling across my face every night - i kid you not. it even got to the point where roaches didn't even bother hiding during the day. they would come out of the ac vents, the sink, the closet, and any dark space out of reach. the roaches have quite the life though. they get to live there for free. 

documented everything which also included my intent to break my lease due to the inability to remediate a serious health issue. manager tried telling me that i was not going to get out of the lease break amount. of course they sent me to collections, not sure if my documentation sent to the collections agency or the property managements company's lack of response helped me win my dispute but i managed to get the collection removed. oh and don't negotiate whatsoever with the colonnade. i felt like the collections reps were more helpful than the staff that work up in corporate. crazy right?

check out the pics. not only was i dealing with roaches when all the drawers got pulled back there was crap left by the other tenant that the cleaning team missed.

first visit was quite helpful. i was given a free sample of some soap to help with a skin reaction. it worked great so i returned to purchase an entire bar but did not know what the name of the soap was. i asked the same lady that helped me earlier and she didn't take any time to get more details of my visit only to tell me she didn't remember and hurried off leaving me to myself to try and figure it out. i am furious! i drove over an hour to come back for that and this is the treatment i get?! a precious little black lady came over and listened and led me to the product she felt i was talking about and it was indeed what i had used.  when i took it to the counter to pay the nasty attitude white lady all of a sudden had time to talk and remembered me now. at this point i find it insulting even more that i am only important when i have money in my hand. i will order from the soap company directly from now on. i won't be back.

this organization was willing and able to take in a stray cat from my area when no one else had "room at the inn"  i had been feeding this little stray and had become very attached to it but could not adopt it. the lady that came to my house to pick up the stray was very sweet and caring.  i could tell she truly had a heart for animals.  i was so grateful that they were able to take it in this cat and care for it.  they are now looking for a home for this cat.  i will never forget how kind and caring they were.

nothing fancy here. they seem to carry the bare minimum of everything; guns, accessories, cleaning supplies and ammo. i am sure if you ask, they could special order whatever you were in the market for. prices were a little on the high side i felt. 

the staff is knowledgeable, but not very friendly. i have been there several times and have yet to see any of the guys smile. 

the range is decent. i sense this is what keeps the place in business. 8 stalls. fairly clean. you are expected to sweep up your own casings. there are shot up cardboard targets available for free for you to attach your own paper targets to. cost, including tax, was $16.01.

i went to physicians physical therapy (avondale) for my tennis elbow i have had for months, i also had pain coming from my neck which caused me horrible headaches, most likely from a pinched nerve.  before i started pt, i couldn't do simple things, like putting something in the microwave, take out the trash, brush my hair or vacuum.  these guys are so wonderful at what they do and really do care, not to mention make you feel like family.  i feel great and am able to resume my normal activities without any issues.  thank you guys.  your the best!!!

unfortunately, i recently had to return a purchase that i made at brilliance new york in vegas. my husband found out how much i spent and needless to say he was not pleased. 

the products literally worked like magic!  i saw instant results with the pore treatment as well as the eye serum. 

the customer service was excellent. anabel at corporate was delightful to work with. even thought they state that they all sales are final, she was able to issue a refund for me in a few days. 

the products are amazing and so is the customer service! i can't wait to place a new order once i have a bit more money saved up :)

saw good reviews on yelp for waldo's and decided to give them a try. ordering was a very easy process. the gentlemen that takes the order repeats the order back and hands the ticket to the cooks right away so they can start on your order while he finishes cashing out. quick team, tacos were done within 10 minutes. 13 tacos totaled $24 rounded up. 

- camarones/shrimp tacos: 3/5, shrimp has a batter that was already soft and soaked in oil. avocados were old and mushy. 

- tripas taco: 2/5: not as good as other places that i've had tripas from. the tripas came out crispy but it was burnt and fatty. 

- asada tacos: 3/5: the meat had very little flavor and tasted bland. relied on limes and hot sauces to help it out. 

- pastor tacos: 4/5: the best out of the four. very flavorful, seasoned well.

unfortunately, the house we purchased and fell in love with has carpet. i say "unfortunate" because we are dog lovers. we own two french bulldogs that we are obsessed with. the only problem is... dogs + carpet =  gross. period. they shed. they track in dirt. they slobber. they snort. they wiggle. they're basically two little piggy-poos that live with us. oink. oink.

what's a girl to do? oh yeah... call nobel cleaners. they're the best. 

there's a reason they have a gazillion five star reviews. it's because they're incredible. we've used their services twice and both times they were extremely thorough, prompt, professional, friendly, and provided a quote and stuck to it. in fact, they over quoted us and upon completion of their work charged us less. yeah, they're top-notch carpet superheroes. 

if your carpets are looking less than dapper and are needing some tlc... give these carpet superheroes a call. they will come to your rescue and have your carpets looking brand new in no time! they're piggy-poo approved.

my son and i went to "the meg" at the red stone cinemas and felt like we pretty much wasted our money. we saw the pdx version (premium digital experience) which, according to what they told us at the ticket counter, was better sound and 3d effects. the only thing that was intense (in a good way) about it was the sound was better, but the picture part of it was not worth the $38 that we paid for.  $38 for one adult and two kids....totally not worth it. plus, the price for food at theaters now is absolutely ridiculous!!!  for the three of us, including the cost of the tickets was over $65. it pretty much costs as much as dinner would cost at a 5-star restaurant. don't get me wrong, i'm not complaining about the movie. the movie was great, very suspenseful. the amount that it cost, however, was totally not worth it!!  we feel like we definitely got ripped off at this theatre!!

if you are thinking about bringing your compound pharmacy needs here - don't! twice now they have had issues filling my prescription in a timely manner causing me to be days without my medication. they take 5 -10 business days to fill a prescription...when things go right. this month i called in my refill 8 days prior to needing it. i prepaid for the medication and, because this location was closed from water damage, they offered one time free delivery. they said it would be delivered on the 22nd (a week away). there was no delivery on the 22nd so i called on the 23rd. they told me they had made a clerical error and my prescription had never been filled. so i'm thinking they are going to put someone right on it and get it done - nope. the earliest they could get it done was in 7 days. i told them i would run out of medication in 2 days - still the earliest they could do was 7 days. i told them this was the second month in a row they haven't been able to fill in a timely manner. they said again, 7 days. if i needed it sooner, i would have to call around to find a compound pharmacy that could get it done sooner. both times, they did nothing to help me and even when it was their mistake- it was my problem. horrible customer service.

very juicy patties. had the double primeburger with poutine. fries are good as well. i liked the way the burgers are wrapped, which made it less messy. the price was also reasonable given the quality of the burgers.

it's a starbucks, what more can you expect? the location is decent, inside the westin hotel and it only gets crowded in the morning hours. there is comfy seating, you can also take your drink over to the bar area on the first floor or sit at one of the slot machines.

everything was great but how does a brand new place run out of food when it just recently opened and it is trying to get loyal customers. half of the things they promote is their food and for them to not be serving it, and without any sign of notice until i got to the register is extremely disappointing. 

the staff seemed extremely all over the place and the person yelling out order numbers was being overly aggressive when calling them out.

miller's handled the work needed for our insurance claim very efficiently and professionally.  we had very significant water damage on a manufactured house.  they communicated promptly both with me and with the insurance company, and with subcontractors.  the subcontractors they referred me to were also very good communicators, and efficient about their work.  all very nice people.  everyone on their team was available and forthcoming with answers to all my questions.  i would recommend them and i would solicit their services again!

this place is the worst "brazilian" restaurant in vegas. has the feel of a sizzler and the quality of food is less appealing. asked for chimichurri and no one working there knew what that was...yeah...real authentic. save your money even if it's the groupon deal.

i'm giving 5 stars for the young officer that came out that had the the tact to deal with a person like me. before this. i live in ahwatukee for some reason the officers here are too salty for their own good. i was on vacation in las vegas and saw on the news some kid got shot at andy's with an air soft gun. walking distance from me. my neighbors across the way had shot me with an air soft gun a month prior and the police did nothing. i'm a mentally unstable veteran and i drink. i get that. but when these two idiots came i was treated very inappropriate. both the rookie and the "veteran" were rude the second they knocked on my door. i guess it's my fault for being stern back to them. even my dog didn't like these dicks and all she does is sleep.
